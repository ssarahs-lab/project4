## Technologies used
ReactJS, Axios, NodeJS, ExpressJS, React-Chatbot-Kit, OpenAI's GPT-3

## Approach taken

For this project, I used React for Front-end and ExpressJS/NodeJS for the backend to make API calls. 

## Installation instructions

   In the root folder:
   
       npm install express
       npm install nodemon
       npm install pg 
       npm install express-session
       npm install axios
       npm install openai
       npm start // or npm run start:dev
 



## Potential Extensions for later

- Using Phaser.io to make a game with the Chatbot
- Adding in a Tamagotchi/pet and making it seem relevant to this app
- Users can make their own bot with customised personalities. 
- Local storage of chatbot history to train GPT-3
